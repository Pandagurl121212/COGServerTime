**Explanation the Guild:** This is meant to be an Open world RPG campaign. The goal is to have fun! Your Character is part of a Guild, though we will start with one main Guild as the game progresses we can have multiple ones, or you may even want to start your own! Guilds run off of Reputation. It is how they can procure the best and most wealthy Quests for their Members. Players will also have their own Reputation to think about, as folks will ask for a specific known adventurer for a task or set a Reputation requirement to larger Quests.


**REMINDERS:** If your character wants to do something, be ready to role play it. Please refrain from killing another player, unless that player is fine with the outcome. If you are uncomfortable or someone else is making you uncomfortable for any reason, please let me know! I have no problem helping my players be happy and have fun but I will not tolerate harassment of any kind. I am a generous but also wrathful GOD (Game Organizing Director)
