1.  **Explanation the Guild:** This is an Open world RPG campaign. The goal is to have fun and be able to play with multiple different players without having to be in multiple different games. Your Character is part of a Guild, though we will start with one main Guild as the game progresses we can have multiple ones, or you may even want to start your own! If a set group of players who all like to play with each other can create what we call a Fellowship. Fellowships are compiled of useful classes that get Quests done quickly, efficiently or with style. Guilds run off of Reputation. It is how they can procure the best and most wealthy Quests for their Members. Players will also have their own Reputation to think about, as folks will ask for a specific known adventurer or Fellowship for a task or set a Reputation requirement to larger Quests.
    
    
    **Quest - Tions! :** Quests will be posted on the Quest board for specific Guilds. Reputation, reward, requirements, and player limit will be posted in game. (EXP will be posted out of game for the quest) If you would like to guest plot in this realm, you can submit a Quest! Once approved it will be added to the Quest Board with a note of who the Guest DM is.
    
    
    **Character Questions:** If your character is away on an ongoing Quest, you are then away from the Guild so please refrain from interacting with that chat and any in town chats you are not present for. (OOG is of course fine) Please do not interact with the in character chats until you have an approved Character! All new Characters will start at level 5! This will be an EXP level up game. I will allow multiple Characters but for now letâ€™s start with one!
    

    
    **REMINDERS:** If your character wants to do something, be ready to role play it. Please refrain from killing another player, unless that player is fine with the outcome. If you are uncomfortable or someone else is making you uncomfortable for any reason, please let me know! I have no problem helping my players be happy and have fun but I will not tolerate harassment of any kind. I am a generous but also wrathful GOD (Game Organizing Director)
