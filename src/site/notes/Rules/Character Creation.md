All new characters start at Level 5. 
**Common Characters: Free to Play:** Human- Humans are everywhere and are very common. Some races with longevity see them as pests or infestations since there are so many. Half elf- Common enough due to the influx in humans in popular towns. Elves- Not as common, but not rare either. Everyone has seen elves wander in and out of towns plenty. Halfling- Halflings love busy cities and are fairly common. 

**Uncommon characters: Give me some details as to WHY you exist:** Dwarf- Not common in busy towns, but more so in rural cities with wide open lands Gnomes- Usually Gnomes do not gather in cities as to not draw too much attention to themselves, there will rarely be more than a few gnomes in the same place. Half Orc- Very uncommon, as they tend to like to stick to small villages near a lush forest. Rarely more than a few in any small city. 

**RARE Characters- You will need a pretty good reason for me to allow these races:** Tieflings- Very rare and always frowned upon. Dragonborn- You rarely see any in small towns, some might not have met one in their life. (absolutely no Dragonborn Paladins) (if you want to play arace I have not listed then let me know, it will most likely fall under the RARE category so COME UP WITH SOMETHING GOOD)
