The Underdark is a mysterious land few can say they ventured to. Some who hail from the Underdark and travel out to the common plane do not tend to stay there for long and those who travel to the Underdark do not always return. It is said that there are many entrances throughout Reighlor, those most are rumored to be in [[The World Of Reighlor/Reighlor Regions/Berburland/Berburland\|Berburland]] which has helped with itâ€™s harsh and unforgiving reputation. Be wary if you come across an entrance to the Underdark, as it might not be there tomorrow... or might be a trap.
