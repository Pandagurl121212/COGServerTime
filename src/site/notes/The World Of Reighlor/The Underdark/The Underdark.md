The Underdark is a mysterious land. Some hail from the Underdark and travel out to the world above. Those who travel to the Underdark do not always return. It is said that there are many entrances throughout Reighlor, those most are rumored to be in [[The World Of Reighlor/Reighlor Regions/Berburland/Berburland\|Berburland]] which helped with itâ€™s harsh and unforgiving name. Be wary if you come across an entrance to the Underdark, as it might not be there tomorrow and it most likely is a trap.
