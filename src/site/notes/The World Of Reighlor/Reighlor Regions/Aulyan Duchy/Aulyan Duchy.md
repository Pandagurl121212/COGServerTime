Mix of all kinds of races and refugees from other continents. The Duchy has dealt with many mergers with other nations which has led it to get to the size it is now. The only real influence that talks here is money. The Duchy seems nice and inclusive from onlookers, though those who live here know of its dark tendencies. The Duchy has a rough relationship with Berburland as they travel there to buy and kidnap slaves, usually those of uncommon races are more susceptible to this than others.
