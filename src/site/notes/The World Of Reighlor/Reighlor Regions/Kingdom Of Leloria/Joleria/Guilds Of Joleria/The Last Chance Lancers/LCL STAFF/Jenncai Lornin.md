Guild Quester - Jenncai Lornin 
- Half Elf Artificer 


About: If anxiety had a picture in the dictionary it would be of Jenncai's face. He is worried about many things and wants to do well. He was chosen to be the Guilds Quester due being able to organize just about anything though he thinks its because his brother got him the position. 
He cares a lot about his brother and would do anything for him. Even leave town and join a guild that sends them on daring, terrifying adventures that could kill him and his brother at any moment....
