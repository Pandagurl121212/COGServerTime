Alley Kraken is just a whisper on the wind and a myth to those who do not know much of the cities underworld or those who do not wish to be involved. This is one of the most efficient crime rings in all of Joleria, possibly all of Leloria though no one can confirm this. 

Those that do know of them can find them down a seedy Alley hidden by strong illusion. Whether you are looking to join the elusive group or hire them for a job is completely up to you to decide before seeking them out. Though be warned that their leader is known to be a master of subterfuge and if a deal is struck with them the likely hood of you making it out on top is slim to none.
