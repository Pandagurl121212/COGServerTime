Cal is a no nonsense type of person. She is logical and makes sure each quest is set at the right standards. She scoffs at those who try to intimidate her into giving them better Quests which usually ends with them going home empty handed or turned into furniture. That beings said she is known to be a bit biased to some Guild members though she denies it of course. Though it does seem like she gives better Quests to those who are pleasant to her or find a way to get her one of her favorite treats. Be wise when deciding though, it is best to try this if she is in a good mood.
