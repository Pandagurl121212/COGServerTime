Vo is a charming young sorcerer. When he talks women and men alike have been known to swoon, which is why being the Guild Advisor was an obvious choice for him. Vo talks a big game and can back it up with his natural magical talent. Even though he seems to be the Guild Casanova he found a soft spot in his heart for an abandoned Opossum-folk during one of his Quests. He brought her back and raised her with the Guild, teaching her magic cause she wanted to be just like him. He is a Proud Papa and cannot imagine any harm befalling his precious Spreelee, and tends to worry constantly when she decides to take up quests.
There was once a time where Vo nearly drowned a member of the Guild for uttering an insult towards his baby girl. Of course someone stopped him in time and the man survived but was banned as COG does not condone hate towards any race. Vo also had to go on leave for a period of time but was able to hold his position as he was defending a member of COG from discrimination. 

You can often find Vo in the tavern trying to convince Fae to give him a chance at a date or doting on Spreelee.
