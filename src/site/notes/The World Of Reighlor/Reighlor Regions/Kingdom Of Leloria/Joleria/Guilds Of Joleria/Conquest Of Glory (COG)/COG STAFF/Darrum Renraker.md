Darrum is an artist with Armor. He takes his time and places care into each item. He wishes for nothing more than to make sure he makes the best, sturdiest and safest armor to protect the members of COG. It is very delicate work placing each chain link, each scale, and heating them to be malleable with his magic without ruining the material. He likes to work in a calm setting listening to the forges fire, which is why he cannot stand Cortix and his unorthodox explosions! Darrum swears that Cortix causes explosions for no reason, other than to annoy him! He cannot understand why this crazy Gnome wishes to torment him and mock his beautiful creations. Cortix acts as if Darrum's craft is menial and unimportant while Darrum thinks Cortix works too quickly for any good to come from it. Cortix's recklessness is why he causes so many explosions! Darrum is sure they will never ever get along during their long lives.
