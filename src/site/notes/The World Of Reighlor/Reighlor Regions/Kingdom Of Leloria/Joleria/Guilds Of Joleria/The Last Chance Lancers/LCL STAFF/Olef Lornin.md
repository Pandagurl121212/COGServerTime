Guild Trainer - Olef Lornin 
- Half Elf Barbarian 

About: Olef is excited about everything. He was excited to become a barbarian, he was excited to join the guild and most of all. Most importantly, he was excited to be himself, which his parents were not as thrilled with. They still called him Olga and thought he was still their daughter which is why he went off to go join a guild! It was actually his brothers idea to go because their parents were not seeing reason as he put it. So they went off together to be the best duo ever!
