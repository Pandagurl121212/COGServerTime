Badyn is a pretty good barkeep, mainly because he can spot when anything unruly behavior is about to start up. He calls it his ‘Drow intuition’ but before most fights break out you can find him already between the ruffians breaking it up or throwing a thieve out that thought it was a good idea to wander in when the members were good and drunk. He works closely with Fae to make sure the members are happy and he respects her greatly, though keen eyes will catch him looking toward her while she is not paying attention. Most assume they think of each other like siblings with how much  joke around and the time they spend together at the bar, but, to some, it seems Badyn might not feel that way…
