Guildâ€™s are composed of adventurers who take on quests to earn reputation, gold, or items. There is a lot that goes into running a guild, like those who run it!

The Guild Master who is in charge of everything the Guild needs, usually a high ranking adventurer who has retired, or who wants to spread their wisdom. 

The Guild Advisor, who gathers new quests to help the Guilds and their members reputation and spreads word to any who wish to join.

The Guild Recruiter, who decides who does and does not have what it takes to become a member. 

The Guild Quester, who sets ranks and requirements for Quests to the Quest Board, they also have the final say on who gets to take the quest. (always be nice to your Quester)


Some Guilds offer different things to help their members or entice new members to join and stay.
