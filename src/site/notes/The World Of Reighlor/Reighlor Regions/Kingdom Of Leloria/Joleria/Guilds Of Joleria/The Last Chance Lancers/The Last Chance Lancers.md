The Last Chance Lancers is the 2nd most productive Guild in Joleria and pride themselves on being the best of the best. They recruit those of the highest caliber or that show great promise. The members of the guild are very close and care about each other almost to an extreme, which sometimes makes them hyper critical of other guilds and their members. 
They are self announced rivals of [[The World Of Reighlor/Reighlor Regions/Kingdom Of Leloria/Joleria/Guilds Of Joleria/Conquest Of Glory (COG)/Conquest Of Glory\|Conquest Of Glory]] though COG does not seem to always agree on that. 

Members are known to showboat and try to prove themselves constantly to their higher ups. Seemingly very overtly masculine they are still caring of those close to them and generally do not tolerate those who are on the toxic side. (Does not mean that there are not those like that in the guild, as such is life.) Many members hold true that it is acceptable to kiss the homies goodnight.
