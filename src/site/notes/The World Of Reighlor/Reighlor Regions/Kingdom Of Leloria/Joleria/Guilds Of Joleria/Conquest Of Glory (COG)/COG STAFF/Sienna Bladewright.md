Being with the Guild for upwards of 25 years, Sienna has become the Guild's best Cleric and gives advice to those who seek it and heals those who come back from missions in rough condition. She is gentle and caring, though in some cases uses tough love to teach lessons. She has a soft and sweet demeanor with an undertone of no-nonsense. Many come to her for advice on a wide variety of things, some subjects she may not think she is the best person for but tries her best nonetheless.
