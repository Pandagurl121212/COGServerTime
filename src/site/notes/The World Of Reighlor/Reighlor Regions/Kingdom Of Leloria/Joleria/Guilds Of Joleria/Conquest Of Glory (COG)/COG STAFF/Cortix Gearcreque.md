Cortix is an inventor among inventors! He loves anything magical and tries to find new ways into making it better. He is in charge of crafting the regular weapons most members of the Guild are in need of, which he can easily forge with his machines. He does enjoy making the basic weapons but loves to research and find new ways to help his fellow members get the best gear around. If you hear an explosion in the Guild it's probably Cortix, though he doesn't seem to mind them they unfortunately infuriate his fellow guild member and artisan Darrum Renraker. The Weapon forge and the Armory are next to each other for obvious reasons and the two who run them despise each other. There has been a long winded rivalry between them for as long as anyone can remember, though no one really knows how it started or why it continues on to this day. They are determined to one up each other at any moment and some may say they like to argue with each other but both will deny it and say they wish the other would fall off a cliff.
