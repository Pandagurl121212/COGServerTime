Charismatic and sweet, many people will say Fae was a great addition to COG. She helps run the tavern along with Badyn and helps things run smoothly. She sings and tries to rejuvenate those returning from Quests and helps prepare those heading out. She is of course very beautiful, though many have learned that she can hold her own when she receives unwanted advances. The one guyâ€™s eye she is trying to catch she fears thinks of her as a sister, but she cannot bring herself to move on just yet, and who is to blame her with the pickings available in the Tavern.
