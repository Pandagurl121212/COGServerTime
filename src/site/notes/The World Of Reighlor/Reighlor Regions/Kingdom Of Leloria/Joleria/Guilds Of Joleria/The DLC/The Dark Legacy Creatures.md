The Dark Legacy Creatures (The DLC) is a gathering of those generally out casted by society. Joining together to become a mercenary guild, claiming to be able to complete any job in any way possible. 

The DLC is not inherently evil but they also do not claim to be good by any means. They offer a lot of leeway to their members to get things done and will back those who are apart of their group against outsiders.
