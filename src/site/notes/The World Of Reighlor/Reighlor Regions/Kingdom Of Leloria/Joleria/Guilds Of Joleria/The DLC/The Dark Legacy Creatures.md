The Dark Legacy Creatures (The DLC) is a gathering of those generally out casted by society. Joining together to become a mercenary guild, claiming to be able to complete any job in any way possible. 

The DLC is not inherently evil but they also do not claim to be good by any means. They offer a lot of leeway to their members to get things done and will back those who are apart of their group against outsiders. 

## The DLC Staff:
#### Guild Master: Rurgar Zo
Age:  
Race:  Tiefling
Class: Warlock
About: No one was surprised to find that the Guild Master of the DLC was a Tiefling or a warlock, but they were surprised by how likeable he was. He is feared for his many many successful missions and his reputation as one of the most merciless mercenaries is widely known. THe acts as though there is no bias against him or his kind or those he employees and generates an air of respect when speaking with anyone. His victims on the other hand see a side of his smile that is truly terrifying to behold.

#### Guild Advisor: Frethah "Fret" Vellum
Age:  
Race:  Firbolg
Class: Wizard
About: Frethah, also known as Fret, is a well educated Firbolg and was deemed the best choice as Guild Advisor for the DLC. He is clear headed though can be caught worrying about things that do not go as planned as he does not deal with mishaps well. He hates surprises as it goes against the plan and he works very hard on those!

#### Guild Recruiter: Nayte Shade
Age:  85
Race:  Drow
Class: Ranger
About: Nayte is a Ranger and oddly playful for a Drow. He is charismatic and thus was picked as the Recruiter for the DLC. He likes to play pranks and poke fun at many members but assures you he means the best. Probably.

#### Guild Quester: Zhikes Tirlla
Age:  
Race:  Owlin
Class: Cleric 
About: Zhikes is a upbeat and happy person, little can crush her optimism. She prides herself in making sure there are plenty of quests available to her guildmates which is why she was picked as the DLC's Quester, though the quests may not be as savory as other guilds would have...or as throughly checked... BUT they are available and more quests equals more money equals happy guild members!

#### Guild Trainer: Chulluk 
Age:  
Race:  Goliath
Class: Fighter
About: As the Trainer of the DLC Chulluk takes his role seriously. Maybe too seriously. He likes to play into the role of brooding mysterious member of the DLC even though many other people in the Guild might not fit that same role.
