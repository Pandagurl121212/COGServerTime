Garg Flayer is an intimidating sight to see. Tall, green and handsome he is actually one of the most friendly people at COG, though maybe a bit to friendly. 
Garg is a tough Recruiter, feeling it is best to push the limits of everyone who wishes to join up with COG. He believes there is always a way to improve yourself, usually he means physically though mentally works too. Everyone has a story of when Garg beat them senseless before letting them join the Guild, some fond memories and some not so muchâ€¦
