Dragon Goddess of Balance and justice

Alignment: Lawful Neutral 
Domain: Balance and justice
Symbol: Scale of Justice, The Balancer, Weigher of Lives
About: The clerics and paladins of Lendys are justice-bringers, often serving as judges and arbiters for local communities.  Lendys' clergy get along well with worshippers of Saint Cuthbert, and poorly with the followers of chaotic gods such as Kord, Olidammara, and Erythnul.
