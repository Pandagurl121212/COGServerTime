Other Realms are vast and many different types exist. It is completely reasonable to see some similar themes between realms. Each Realm has it's own plain and many have gotten lost in them either by accident or on purpose. Mortals have been known to go to escape or be taken due to a deal going awry. 

(If you would like a specific realm added please let me know!)
