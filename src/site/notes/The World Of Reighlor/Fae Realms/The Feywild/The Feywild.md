The Feywild have a strong presence in the [[The World Of Reighlor/Reighlor Regions/Ulmesse Empire/Ulmesse Empire\|Ulmesse Empire]] and [[The World Of Reighlor/Reighlor Regions/Berburland/Berburland\|Berburland]], being forced out of other areas in the past and avoid the new technology of those lands. They have an understanding with the Ulmesse Empress which helps them not crumble under the ever growing lands of other nations. Feywild doors can open in other areas but rarely, and are abundant in Berburland which can cause folks to wander in without knowing and by then it's too late.
